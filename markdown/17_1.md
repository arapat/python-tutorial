### closing files with with

We use the \"with\" statement to open and close files.[^1][^2]

``` {.python}
with open("in_test.txt", "rt") as in_file:
    with open("out_test.txt", "wt") as out_file:
        text = in_file.read()
        data = parse(text)
        results = encode(data)
        out_file.write(results)
    print( "All done." )
```

If some sort of error happens anywhere in this code (one of the files is
inaccessible, the parse() function chokes on corrupt data, etc.) the
\"with\" statements guarantee that all the files will eventually be
properly closed. Closing a file just means that the file is \"cleaned
up\" and \"released\" by our program so that it can be used in another
program.
