### The pip module

The pip module is a module that comes with the python installation and
acts as a module downloader/manager. You can download other modules from
the internet with pip.

The pip module is not used in the python interpreter, but is run through
the command line. To use it, open up your command line interpreter (for
Windows it is Command Prompt, for Mac/Linux it is Terminal) and type in
the following code:

``` {.bash}
py3 -m pip install module
```

or the alternate code

``` {.bash}
pip install module
```

This will try to download and install module from the user-submitted
python modules database. Module can be changed to the name of the
module.
