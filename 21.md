So here we are at the end, or maybe the beginning. This tutorial is on
Wikibooks, so feel free to make improvements to it. If you want to learn
more about Python, [The Python
Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) by [Guido van
Rossum](http://www.python.org/~guido/) has more topics that you can
learn about. If you have been following this tutorial, you should be
able to understand a fair amount of it. The [Python
Programming](Python_Programming "wikilink") wikibook can be worth
looking at, too. Here are few other books which cover Python 3:

-   [A Byte of Python by Swaroop C
    H](http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/Python)
-   [DataCamp Interactive Python 3 Tutorial -
    Online](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)
-   [Hands-on Python Tutorial by Dr. Andrew N.
    Harrington](http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/index.html)
-   [Subject:Python programming
    language](Subject:Python_programming_language "wikilink") lists
    other Wikibooks related to Python.

Hopefully this book covers everything you have needed to get started
programming. Thanks to everyone who has sent me emails about it. I
enjoyed reading them, even when I have not always been the best replier.

Happy programming, may it change your life and the world.

### FAQ

How do I make a GUI in Python? : You can use one of these library: [TKinter](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/tkinter.html), [PyQt](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro), [PyGobject](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/PyGObject). For really simple graphics, you can use the turtle graphics mode `import turtle`\
How do I make a game in Python? : The best method is probably to use PyGame at <http://pygame.org/>\
How do I make an executable from a Python program? : Short answer: Python is an interepreted language so that is impossible. Long answer is that something similar to an executable can be created by taking the Python interpreter and the file and joining them together and distributing that. For more on that problem see <http://www.python.org/doc/faq/programming/#how-can-i-create-a-stand-alone-binary-from-a-python-script>\
(IFAQ) Why do you use first person in this tutorial? : Once upon a time in a different millenia, (1999 to be exact), an earlier version was written entirely by Josh Cogliati, and it was up on his webpage <http://www.honors.montana.edu/~jjc/easytut> and it was good. Then the server rupert, like all good things than have a beginning came to an end, and Josh moved it to Wikibooks, but the first person writing stuck. If someone really wants to change it, I will not revert it, but I don\'t see much point. (The webpage has since moved to <http://jjc.freeshell.org/easytut/> and <http://jjc.freeshell.org/easytut3/> )\
My question is not answered. : Ask on the discussion page or add it to this FAQ, or email one of the [Authors](../Authors "wikilink").
