### If statement

As always, I believe I should start each chapter with a warm-up typing
exercise, so here is a short program to compute the absolute value of an
integer:

``` {.python}
n = int(input("Number? "))
if n < 0:
   print("The absolute value of", n, "is", -n)
else:
   print("The absolute value of", n, "is", n)
```

Here is the output from the two times that I ran this program:

`Number? `**`-34`**\
`The absolute value of -34 is 34`

`Number? `**`1`**\
`The absolute value of 1 is 1`

So what does the computer do when it sees this piece of code? First it
prompts the user for a number with the statement
\"`n = int(input("Number? "))`\". Next it reads the line
\"`if n < 0:`\". If `n` is less than zero Python runs the line
\"`print("The absolute value of", n, "is", -n)`\". Otherwise it runs the
line \"`print("The absolute value of", n, "is", n)`\".

More formally Python looks at whether the *expression* `n < 0` is true
or false. An `if` statement is followed by an indented *block* of
statements that are run when the expression is true. Optionally after
the `if` statement is an `else` statement and another indented *block*
of statements. This second block of statements is run if the expression
is false.

There are a number of different tests that an expression can have. Here
is a table of all of them:

  operator   function
  ---------- --------------------------
  `<`        less than
  `<=`       less than or equal to
  `>`        greater than
  `>=`       greater than or equal to
  `==`       equal
  `!=`       not equal

Another feature of the `if` command is the `elif` statement. It stands
for else if and means if the original `if` statement is false but the
`elif` part is true, then do the `elif` part. And if neither the `if` or
`elif` expressions are true, then do what\'s in the `else` block.
Here\'s an example:

``` {.python}
a = 0
while a < 10:
    a = a + 1
    if a > 5:
        print(a, ">", 5)
    elif a <= 3:
        print(a, "<=", 3)
    else:
        print("Neither test was true")
```

and the output:

`1 <= 3`\
`2 <= 3`\
`3 <= 3`\
`Neither test was true`\
`Neither test was true`\
`6 > 5`\
`7 > 5`\
`8 > 5`\
`9 > 5`\
`10 > 5`

Notice how the `elif a <= 3` is only tested when the `if` statement
fails to be true. There can be more than one `elif` expression, allowing
multiple tests to be done in a single `if` statement.
