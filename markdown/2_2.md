### Expressions

Here is another program:

``` {.python}
print("2 + 2 is", 2 + 2)
print("3 * 4 is", 3 * 4)
print("100 - 1 is", 100 - 1)
print("(33 + 2) / 5 + 11.5 is", (33 + 2) / 5 + 11.5)
```

And here is the *output* when the program is run:

`2 + 2 is 4`\
`3 * 4 is 12`\
`100 - 1 is 99`\
`(33 + 2) / 5 + 11.5 is 18.5`

As you can see, Python can turn your thousand-dollar computer into a
five-dollar calculator.

#### Arithmetic expressions

In this example, the print function is followed by two arguments, with
each of the arguments separated by a comma. So with the first line of
the program

``` {.python}
print("2 + 2 is", 2 + 2)
```

The first argument is the string `"2 + 2 is"` and the second argument is
the *arithmetic expression* `2 + 2`, which is one kind of *expression*.

What is important to note is that a string is printed as is (without the
enclosing double quotes), but an *expression* is *evaluated*, or
converted to its actual value.

Python has seven basic operations for numbers:

  Operation                Symbol   Example
  ------------------------ -------- -------------------------------
  Power (exponentiation)   `**`     `5 ** 2 == 25`
  Multiplication           `*`      `2 * 3 == 6`
  Division                 `/`      `14 / 3 == 4.666666666666667`
  Integer Division         `//`     `14 // 3 == 4`
  Remainder (modulo)       `%`      `14 % 3 == 2`
  Addition                 `+`      `1 + 2 == 3`
  Subtraction              `-`      `4 - 3 == 1`

Notice that there are two ways to do division, one that returns the
repeating decimal, and the other that can get the remainder and the
whole number. The order of operations is the same as in math:

-   parentheses `()`
-   exponents `**`
-   multiplication `*`, division `/`, integer division `//`, and
    remainder `%`
-   addition `+` and subtraction `-`

So use parentheses to structure your formulas when needed.
