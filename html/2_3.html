<p>Often in programming you are doing something complicated and may not in the future remember what you did. When this happens the program should probably be commented. A <em>comment</em> is a note to you and other programmers explaining what is happening. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="co"># Not quite PI, but a credible simulation</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="bu">print</span>(<span class="dv">22</span> <span class="op">/</span> <span class="dv">7</span>)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Which outputs</p>
<p><code>3.14285714286</code></p>
<p>Notice that the comment starts with a hash: <code>#</code>. Comments are used to communicate with others who read the program and your future self to make clear what is complicated.</p>
<p>Note that any text can follow a comment, and that when the program is run, the text after the <code>#</code> through to the end of that line is ignored. The <code>#</code> does not have to be at the beginning of a new line:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="co"># Output PI on the screen</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="bu">print</span>(<span class="dv">22</span> <span class="op">/</span> <span class="dv">7</span>) <span class="co"># Well, just a good approximation</span></a></code></pre></div>
