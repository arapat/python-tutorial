Here is a little example of boolean expressions (you don\'t have to type
it in):

``` {.python}
a = 6
b = 7
c = 42
print(1, a == 6)
print(2, a == 7)
print(3, a == 6 and b == 7)
print(4, a == 7 and b == 7)
print(5, not a == 7 and b == 7)
print(6, a == 7 or b == 7)
print(7, a == 7 or b == 6)
print(8, not (a == 7 and b == 6))
print(9, not a == 7 and b == 6)
```

With the output being:

`1 True`\
`2 False`\
`3 True`\
`4 False`\
`5 True`\
`6 True`\
`7 False`\
`8 True`\
`9 False`

What is going on? The program consists of a bunch of funny looking
`print` statements. Each `print` statement prints a number and an
expression. The number is to help keep track of which statement I am
dealing with. Notice how each expression ends up being either `False` or
`True`. In Python false can also be written as 0 and true as 1.

The lines:

``` {.python}
print(1, a == 6)
print(2, a == 7)
```

print out a `True` and a `False` respectively just as expected since the
first is true and the second is false. The third print,
`print(3, a == 6 and b == 7)`, is a little different. The operator `and`
means if both the statement before and the statement after are true then
the whole expression is true otherwise the whole expression is false.
The next line, `print(4, a == 7 and b == 7)`, shows how if part of an
`and` expression is false, the whole thing is false. The behavior of
`and` can be summarized as follows:

  expression          result
  ------------------- --------
  true `and` true     true
  true `and` false    false
  false `and` true    false
  false `and` false   false

Notice that if the first expression is false Python does not check the
second expression since it knows the whole expression is false. Try
running `False and print("Hi")` and compare this to running
`True and print("Hi")` The technical term for this is [short-circuit
evaluation](w:Short-circuit_evaluation "wikilink")

The next line, `print(5, not a == 7 and b == 7)`, uses the `not`
operator. `not` just gives the opposite of the expression. (The
expression could be rewritten as `print(5, a != 7 and b == 7)`). Here is
the table:

  expression    result
  ------------- --------
  `not` true    false
  `not` false   true

The two following lines, `print(6, a == 7 or b == 7)` and
`print(7, a == 7 or b == 6)`, use the `or` operator. The `or` operator
returns true if the first expression is true, or if the second
expression is true or both are true. If neither are true it returns
false. Here\'s the table:

  expression         result
  ------------------ --------
  true `or` true     true
  true `or` false    true
  false `or` true    true
  false `or` false   false

Notice that if the first expression is true Python doesn\'t check the
second expression since it knows the whole expression is true. This
works since `or` is true if at least one half of the expression is true.
The first part is true so the second part could be either false or true,
but the whole expression is still true.

The next two lines, `print(8, not (a == 7 and b == 6))` and
`print(9, not a == 7 and b == 6)`, show that parentheses can be used to
group expressions and force one part to be evaluated first. Notice that
the parentheses changed the expression from false to true. This occurred
since the parentheses forced the `not` to apply to the whole expression
instead of just the `a == 7` portion.

Here is an example of using a boolean expression:

``` {.python}
list = ["Life", "The Universe", "Everything", "Jack", "Jill", "Life", "Jill"]

# make a copy of the list. See the More on Lists chapter to explain what [:] means.
copy = list[:]
# sort the copy
copy.sort()
prev = copy[0]
del copy[0]

count = 0

# go through the list searching for a match
while count < len(copy) and copy[count] != prev:
    prev = copy[count]
    count = count + 1

# If a match was not found then count can't be < len
# since the while loop continues while count is < len
# and no match is found

if count < len(copy):
    print("First Match:", prev)
```

And here is the output:

`First Match: Jill`

This program works by continuing to check for match
`while count < len(copy) and copy[count] is not equal to prev`. When
either `count` is greater than the last index of `copy` or a match has
been found the `and` is no longer true so the loop exits. The `if`
simply checks to make sure that the `while` exited because a match was
found.

The other \"trick\" of `and` is used in this example. If you look at the
table for `and` notice that the third entry is \"false and false\". If
`count >= len(copy)` (in other words `count < len(copy)` is false) then
`copy[count]` is never looked at. This is because Python knows that if
the first is false then they can\'t both be true. This is known as a
short circuit and is useful if the second half of the `and` will cause
an error if something is wrong. I used the first expression
(`count < len(copy)`) to check and see if `count` was a valid index for
`copy`. (If you don\'t believe me remove the matches \"Jill\" and
\"Life\", check that it still works and then reverse the order of
`count < len(copy) and copy[count] != prev` to
`copy[count] != prev and count < len(copy)`.)

Boolean expressions can be used when you need to check two or more
different things at once.

### A note on Boolean Operators

A common mistake for people new to programming is a misunderstanding of
the way that boolean operators works, which stems from the way the
python interpreter reads these expressions. For example, after initially
learning about \"and \" and \"or\" statements, one might assume that the
expression `x == ('a' or 'b')` would check to see if the variable `x`
was equivalent to one of the strings `'a'` or `'b'`. This is not so. To
see what I\'m talking about, start an interactive session with the
interpreter and enter the following expressions:

`>>> 'a' == ('a' or 'b')`\
`>>> 'b' == ('a' or 'b')`\
`>>> 'a' == ('a' and 'b')`\
`>>> 'b' == ('a' and 'b')`

And this will be the unintuitive result:

`>>>`*`'`` ``'a'`` ``==`` ``('a'`` ``or`` ``'b')`*`'`\
`True`\
`>>>`*`'`` ``'b'`` ``==`` ``('a'`` ``or`` ``'b')`*`'`\
`False`\
`>>>`*`'`` ``'a'`` ``==`` ``('a'`` ``and`` ``'b')`*`'`\
`False `\
`>>>`*`'`` ``'b'`` ``==`` ``('a'`` ``and`` ``'b')`*`'`\
`True`

At this point, the `and` and `or` operators seem to be broken. It
doesn\'t make sense that, for the first two expressions, `'a'` is
equivalent to `'a'` or `'b'` while `'b'` is not. Furthermore, it
doesn\'t make any sense that \'b\' is equivalent to `'a'` and `'b'`.
After examining what the interpreter does with boolean operators, these
results do in fact exactly what you are asking of them, it\'s just not
the same as what you think you are asking.

When the Python interpreter looks at an `or` expression, it takes the
first statement and checks to see if it is true. If the first statement
is true, then Python returns that object\'s value without checking the
second statement. This is because for an `or` expression, the whole
thing is true if one of the values is true; the program does not need to
bother with the second statement. On the other hand, if the first value
is evaluated as false Python checks the second half and returns that
value. That second half determines the truth value of the whole
expression since the first half was false. This \"laziness\" on the part
of the interpreter is called \"short circuiting\" and is a common way of
evaluating boolean expressions in many programming languages.

Similarly, for an `and` expression, Python uses a short circuit
technique to speed truth value evaluation. If the first statement is
false then the whole thing must be false, so it returns that value.
Otherwise if the first value is true it checks the second and returns
that value.

One thing to note at this point is that the boolean expression returns a
value indicating `True` or `False`, but that Python considers a number
of different things to have a truth value assigned to them. To check the
truth value of any given object `x`, you can use the fuction `bool(x)`
to see its truth value. Below is a table with examples of the truth
values of various objects:

  True                      False
  ------------------------- ---------------------
  True                      False
  1                         0
  Numbers other than zero   The string \'None\'
  Nonempty strings          Empty strings
  Nonempty lists            Empty lists
  Nonempty dictionaries     Empty dictionaries

Now it is possible to understand the perplexing results we were getting
when we tested those boolean expressions before. Let\'s take a look at
what the interpreter \"sees\" as it goes through that code:

**First case:**

`>>>`*`'`` ``'a'`` ``==`` ``('a'`` ``or`` ``'b')`*`'  # Look at parentheses first, so evaluate expression "('a' or 'b')"`\
`                           # 'a' is a nonempty string, so the first value is True`\
`                           # Return that first value: 'a'`\
`>>>''' 'a' == 'a' '''          # the string 'a' is equivalent to the string 'a', so expression is True`\
`True`

**Second case:**

`>>>`*`'`` ``'b'`` ``==`` ``('a'`` ``or`` ``'b')`*`'  # Look at parentheses first, so evaluate expression "('a' or 'b')"`\
`                           # 'a' is a nonempty string, so the first value is True`\
`                           # Return that first value: 'a'`\
`>>>''' 'b' == 'a' '''          # the string 'b' is not equivalent to the string 'a', so expression is False`\
`False `

**Third case:**

`>>>`*`'`` ``'a'`` ``==`` ``('a'`` ``and`` ``'b')`*`' # Look at parentheses first, so evaluate expression "('a' and 'b')"`\
`                           # 'a' is a nonempty string, so the first value is True, examine second value`\
`                           # 'b' is a nonempty string, so second value is True`\
`                           # Return that second value as result of whole expression: 'b'`\
`>>>''' 'a' == 'b' '''          # the string 'a' is not equivalent to the string 'b', so expression is False`\
`False`

**Fourth case:**

`>>>`*`'`` ``'b'`` ``==`` ``('a'`` ``and`` ``'b')`*`' # Look at parentheses first, so evaluate expression "('a' and 'b')"`\
`                           # 'a' is a nonempty string, so the first value is True, examine second value`\
`                           # 'b' is a nonempty string, so second value is True`\
`                           # Return that second value as result of whole expression: 'b'`\
`>>>''' 'b' == 'b' '''          # the string 'b' is equivalent to the string 'b', so expression is True`\
`True `

So Python was really doing its job when it gave those apparently bogus
results. As mentioned previously, the important thing is to recognize
what value your boolean expression will return when it is evaluated,
because it isn\'t always obvious.

Going back to those initial expressions, this is how you would write
them out so they behaved in a way that you want:

`>>>''' 'a' == 'a' or 'a' == 'b' '''`\
`True`\
`>>>''' 'b' == 'a' or 'b' == 'b' '''`\
`True`\
`>>>''' 'a' == 'a' and 'a' == 'b' '''`\
`False`\
`>>>''' 'b' == 'a' and 'b' == 'b' '''`\
`False`

When these comparisons are evaluated they return truth values in terms
of True or False, not strings, so we get the proper results.

### Examples

**password1.py**

``` {.python}
## This program asks a user for a name and a password.
# It then checks them to make sure that the user is allowed in.

name = input("What is your name? ")
password = input("What is the password? ")
if name == "Josh" and password == "Friday":
    print("Welcome Josh")
elif name == "Fred" and password == "Rock":
    print("Welcome Fred")
else:
    print("I don't know you.")
```

Sample runs

`What is your name? `**`Josh`**\
`What is the password? `**`Friday`**\
`Welcome Josh`

`What is your name? `**`Bill`**\
`What is the password? `**`Money`**\
`I don't know you.`

### Exercises

Write a program that has a user guess your name, but they only get 3
chances to do so until the program quits.
