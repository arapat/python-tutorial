### Exercises

Rewrite the `high_low.py` program from section
[Decisions](../Decisions#Examples "wikilink") to use an random integer
between 0 and 99 instead of the hard-coded 78. Use the Python
documentation to find an appropriate module and function to do this.

Other modules
-------------

Sometimes you want to use a python module that does not come with the
Python installation. You can also import those, but you have to have
them installed on your computer.
