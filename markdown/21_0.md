So here we are at the end, or maybe the beginning. This tutorial is on
Wikibooks, so feel free to make improvements to it. If you want to learn
more about Python, [The Python
Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) by [Guido van
Rossum](http://www.python.org/~guido/) has more topics that you can
learn about. If you have been following this tutorial, you should be
able to understand a fair amount of it. The [Python
Programming](Python_Programming "wikilink") wikibook can be worth
looking at, too. Here are few other books which cover Python 3:

-   [A Byte of Python by Swaroop C
    H](http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/Python)
-   [DataCamp Interactive Python 3 Tutorial -
    Online](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)
-   [Hands-on Python Tutorial by Dr. Andrew N.
    Harrington](http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/index.html)
-   [Subject:Python programming
    language](Subject:Python_programming_language "wikilink") lists
    other Wikibooks related to Python.

Hopefully this book covers everything you have needed to get started
programming. Thanks to everyone who has sent me emails about it. I
enjoyed reading them, even when I have not always been the best replier.

Happy programming, may it change your life and the world.
