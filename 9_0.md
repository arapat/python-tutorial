### Variables with more than one value

You have already seen ordinary variables that store a single value.
However other variable types can hold more than one value. These are
called containers because they can contain more than one object. The
simplest type is called a list. Here is an example of a list being used:

``` {.python}
which_one = int(input("What month (1-12)? "))
months = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July',
          'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December']

if 1 <= which_one <= 12:
    print("The month is", months[which_one - 1])
```

and an output example:

`What month (1-12)? `**`3`**\
`The month is March`

In this example the `months` is a list. `months` is defined with the
lines
`months = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July',`
and `'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December']` (note
that a `\` could also be used to split a long line, but that is not
necessary in this case because Python is intelligent enough to recognize
that everything within brackets belongs together). The `[` and `]` start
and end the list with commas (`,`) separating the list items. The list
is used in `months[which_one - 1]`. A list consists of items that are
numbered starting at 0. In other words if you wanted January you would
use `months[0]`. Give a list a number and it will return the value that
is stored at that location.

The statement `if 1 <= which_one <= 12:` will only be true if
`which_one` is between one and twelve inclusive (in other words it is
what you would expect if you have seen that in algebra).

Lists can be thought of as a series of boxes. Each box has a different
value. For example, the boxes created by
`demolist = ['life', 42, 'the universe', 6, 'and', 9]` would look like
this:

  box number   0          1    2                  3   4         5
  ------------ ---------- ---- ------------------ --- --------- ---
  demolist     \"life\"   42   \"the universe\"   6   \"and\"   9

Each box is referenced by its number so the statement `demolist[0]`
would get `'life'`, `demolist[1]` would get `42` and so on up to
`demolist[5]` getting `9`.
