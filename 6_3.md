### How do I fix my program?

You need to figure out what the program is doing. You need to figure out
what the program should do. Figure out what the difference between the
two is. Debugging is a skill that has to be practiced to be learned. If
you can\'t figure it out after an hour, take a break, talk to someone
about the problem or contemplate the lint in your navel. Come back in a
while and you will probably have new ideas about the problem. Good luck.
