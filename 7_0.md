### Creating Functions

To start off this chapter I am going to give you an example of what you
could do but shouldn\'t (so don\'t type it in):

``` {.python}
a = 23
b = -23

if a < 0:
    a = -a
if b < 0:
    b = -b
if a == b:
    print("The absolute values of", a, "and", b, "are equal.")
else:
    print("The absolute values of", a, "and", b, "are different.")
```

with the output being:

`The absolute values of 23 and 23 are equal.`

The program seems a little repetitive. Programmers hate to repeat things
\-- that\'s what computers are for, after all! (Note also that finding
the absolute value changed the value of the variable, which is why it is
printing out 23, and not -23 in the output.) Fortunately Python allows
you to create functions to remove duplication. Here is the rewritten
example:

``` {.python}
a = 23
b = -23

def absolute_value(n):
    if n < 0:
        n = -n
    return n

if absolute_value(a) == absolute_value(b):
    print("The absolute values of", a, "and", b, "are equal.")
else:
    print("The absolute values of", a, "and", b, "are different.")
```

with the output being:

`The absolute values of 23 and -23 are equal.`

The key feature of this program is the `def` statement. `def` (short for
define) starts a function definition. `def` is followed by the name of
the function `absolute_value`. Next comes a \'(\' followed by the
parameter `n` (`n` is passed from the program into the function when the
function is called). The statements after the \':\' are executed when
the function is used. The statements continue until either the indented
statements end or a `return` is encountered. The `return` statement
returns a value back to the place where the function was called. We
already have encountered a function in our very first program, the
`print` function. Now we can make new functions.

Notice how the values of `a` and `b` are not changed. Functions can be
used to repeat tasks that don\'t return values. Here are some examples:

``` {.python}
def hello():
    print("Hello")

def area(width, height):
    return width * height

def print_welcome(name):
    print("Welcome", name)

hello()
hello()

print_welcome("Fred")
w = 4
h = 5
print("width =", w, " height =", h, " area =", area(w, h))
```

with output being:

`Hello`\
`Hello`\
`Welcome Fred`\
`width = 4  height = 5  area = 20`

That example shows some more stuff that you can do with functions.
Notice that you can use no arguments or two or more. Notice also when a
function doesn\'t need to send back a value, a return is optional.
