### Talking to humans (and other intelligent beings)

Often in programming you are doing something complicated and may not in
the future remember what you did. When this happens the program should
probably be commented. A *comment* is a note to you and other
programmers explaining what is happening. For example:

``` {.python}
# Not quite PI, but a credible simulation
print(22 / 7)
```

Which outputs

`3.14285714286`

Notice that the comment starts with a hash: `#`. Comments are used to
communicate with others who read the program and your future self to
make clear what is complicated.

Note that any text can follow a comment, and that when the program is
run, the text after the `#` through to the end of that line is ignored.
The `#` does not have to be at the beginning of a new line:

``` {.python}
# Output PI on the screen
print(22 / 7) # Well, just a good approximation
```
