Object Oriented Programming
---------------------------

Up until now, the programming you have been doing has been procedural.
However, a lot of programs today are Object Oriented. Knowing both
types, and knowing the difference, is very important. Many important
languages in computer science such as C++ and Java, often use OOP
methods.

Beginners, and non-programmers often find the concept of OOP confusing,
and complicated. This is normal. Don\'t be put off if you struggle or do
not understand. There are plenty of other resources you can use to help
overcome any issues you may have, if this chapter does not help you.

This chapter will be broken up into different lessons. Each lesson will
explain OOP in a different way, just to make sure OOP is covered as
thoroughly as possible, because <b>IT IS VERY IMPORTANT.</b> Before the
lessons, there is an introduction which explains key concepts, terms,
and other important areas of OOP, required to understand each lesson.

Introduction
------------

Think of a procedure as a function. A function has a specific purpose.
That purpose may be gathering input, performing mathematical
calculations, displaying data, or manipulating data to, from, or in, a
file. Typically, procedures use data which is separate from code for
manipulation. This data is often passed between procedures. When a
program becomes much larger and complex, this can cause problems. For
example, you have designed a program which stores information about a
product in variables. When a customer requests information on a product,
these variables are passed to different functions for different
purposes. Later on, as more data is stored on these products, you decide
to store the information in a list or dictionary. In order for your
program to function, you must now edit each function that accepted
variables, to now accept and manipulate a list or dictionary. Imagine
the time that would take for a program that was hundreds of megabytes,
and hundreds of files in size! It would drive you insane! not to
mention, errors in your code, are almost guaranteed, just because of the
large volume of work and possibilities to make a typo or other error.
This is less than optimal. Procedural programming is centered on
procedures or functions. But, OOP is centered on creating Objects.
Remember how a procedural program has separated data and code? Remember
how that huge program was hundreds of files and would take FOREVER to
edit? Well, think of an <i>object</i> as a sort of \"combination\" of
those files and data into one \"being\". In a technical sense, an Object
is an entity which contains data, AND procedures (code, functions,
etc.).

<b>Data inside an object is called a <i>data attribute</i></b>.\
<b>Functions, or procedures inside the object are called
<i>methods</i></b>.\

Think of <b>data attributes</b> as variables.\
Think of <b>methods</b> as functions or procedures.\
Let\'s look at a simple, everyday example. The light and light switch in
your bedroom. The data attributes would be as follows.

-   light\_on (True or False)
-   switch\_position (Up or Down)
-   electricity\_flow (True or False)

The methods would be as follows.

-   move\_switch
-   change\_electricity\_flow

The data attributes may or may not be visible. For example, you cannot
directly see the electricity flowing to the light. You only know there
is electricity, because the light is on. However, you can see the
position of the switch (switch\_position), and you can see if the light
is on or off (light\_on). Some methods are <i>private</i>. This means
that you cannot directly change them. For example, unless you cut the
wires in your light fixture (please don\'t do that, and for the sake of
this example, assume that you don\'t know the wires exist), you cannot
change the flow of electricity directly. You also cannot directly change
if the light is on or off (and no, you can\'t unscrew the bulb! work
with me here!). However, you can indirectly change these attributes by
using the <i>methods</i> in the object. If you don\'t pay your bill, the
`change_electricity_flow` method will change the value of the
`electricity_flow` attribute to FALSE. If you flip the switch, the
`move_switch` method changes the value of the `light_on` attribute.

By now you\'re probably thinking, \"What does this have to do with
Python?\" or, \"I understand, but how do I code an Object?\" Well, we
are almost to that point! One more concept must be explained before we
can dive into code.

In Python, an object\'s data attributes and methods are specified by a
<b>class</b>. Think of a class as a blueprint to an object. For example,
your home - the object that you live in - you can also call it your pad,
bungalow, crib, or whatever, was built based on a set of blueprints;
these blueprints would be considered the class used to design your home,
pad, crib, ahem, you get the idea.

Again, a class tells us how to make an object. In technical terms, and
this is important here, a class defines the data attributes and methods
inside an object.

To create a class, we code a <i>class definition</i>. A class definition
is a group of statements which define an object\'s data attributes and
methods.

<big><b>Lesson One</b></big>

Below is a Procedural program that performs simple math on a single
number, entered by a user.

``` {.python}

# Program by Mitchell Aikens
# No Copyright
# 2012

# Procedure 1
def main():
    try:
        # Get a number to maniuplate
        num = float(input("Please enter a number to manipulate.\n"))
        # Store the result of the value, after it has been manipulated
        # by Procedure 2
        addednum = addfive(num)
        # Store the result of the value, after it has been manipulated
        # by Procedure 3
        multipliednum = multiply(addednum)
        # Send the value to Procedure 4
        display(multipliednum)
    # Deal with exceptions from non-numeric user entry
    except ValueError:
        print("You must enter a valid number.\n")
        # Reset the value of num, to clear non-numeric data.
        num = 0
        # Call main, again.
        main()

# Procedure 2
def addfive(num):
    return num + 5

# Procedure 3
def multiply(addednum):
    return addednum * 2.452

# Procedure 4
def display(multi):
    # Display the final value
    print("The final value is ",multi)

# Call Procedure 1
main()
```

If we were to enter a value of \"5\", the output would be as shown
below.

`Please enter a number to manipulate.`\
`5`\
`The final value is  24.52`

If we were to enter a value of \"g\", and then correct the input and
enter a value of \"8\", the output would be as shown below.

`Please enter a number to manipulate.`\
`g`\
`You must enter a valid number.`\
\
`Please enter a number to manipulate.`\
`8`\
`The final value is  31.875999999999998`

Below, is a Class, and a program which uses that class. This Object
Oriented Program does the same thing as the procedural program above.
Let\'s cover some important OOP coding concepts before we dive into the
Class and program. To create a class, we use the `class` keyword. After
the keyword, you type the name you want to name your class. It is common
practice that the name of your class uses CapWords convention. If I
wanted to create a class named dirtysocks, the code would be:

``` {.python}
class DirtySocks
```

The Class is shown first. The program which uses the class is second.

``` {.python}
# Filename: oopexample.py

# OOP Demonstration - Class

class NumChange:

    def __init__(self):
        self.__number = 0

    def addfive(self,num):
        self.__number = num
        return self.__number + 5

    def multiply(self,added):
        self.__added = added
        return self.__added * 2.452
```

The program which uses the class above, is below.

``` {.python}
# Filename: oopexampleprog.py

# OOP Demonstration - Program

import oopexample

maths = oopexample.NumChange()

def main():

    num = float(input("Please enter a number.\n"))

    added = maths.addfive(num)

    multip = maths.multiply(added)

    print("The manipulated value is ",multip)

main()
```

After looking at that program, you are probably a bit lost. That\'s OK.
Let\'s start off by dissecting the class. The class is named
\"NumChange\" There are three methods to this class:

-   \_\_init\_\_
-   addfive
-   multiply

These three methods each have a similar code.

``` {.python}
def __init__(self):
def addfive(self,num):
def multiply(self,added):
```

Notice how each method has a parameter named \"self\". This parameter
must be present in each method of the class. This parameter doesn\'t
HAVE TO be called \"self\", but it is standard practice, which means you
should probably stick with it. This parameter is required in each method
because when a method executes, it has to know which object\'s
attributes to operate on. Even though there is only one Object, we still
need to make sure the interpreter knows that we want to use the data
attributes in that class. So we play it safe\...and use the \"self\"
parameter.

Let\'s look at the first method.

``` {.python}
def __init__(self):
```

Most Classes in Python have an `__init__` which executes automatically
when an instance of a class is created in memory. (When we reference a
class, an <i>instance</i> \[or object\] of that class is created.) This
method is commonly referred to as the <i>initializer method</i>. When
the method executes, the \"self\" parameter is automatically assigned to
the object. This method is called the initializer method because is
\"initializes\" the data attributes. ↵Under the \_\_init\_\_ method, we
set the value of the `number` attribute to 0 initially. We reference the
object attribute using dot notation.

``` {.python}
def __init__(self):
    self.__number = 0
```

The `self.__number = 0` line simply means \"\"the value of the attribute
\"number\", in the object, is 0\"\".

Let\'s look at the next method.

``` {.python}
def addfive(self,num):
    self.__number = num
    return self.__number + 5
```

This method is named \"addfive\". It accepts a parameter called \"num\",
from the program using the class. The method then assigns the value of
that parameter to the \"number\" attribute inside the object. The method
then returns the value of \"number\", with 5 added to it, to the
statement which called the method.

Let\'s look at the third method.

``` {.python}
def multiply(self,added):
    self.__added = added
    return self.__added * 2.453
```

This method is named \"multiply\". It accepts a parameter named
\"added\". It assigns the value of the parameter to the \"added\"
attribute, and returns the value of the \"added\" attribute multiplied
by 2.452, to the statement which called the method.

Notice how the name of each method begins with two underscores? Let\'s
explain that. Earlier we mentioned that an object operates on data
attributes inside itself using methods. Ideally, these data attributes
should be able to be manipulated ONLY BY METHODS IN THE OBJECT. It is
possible to have outside code manipulate data attributes. To \"hide\"
attributes, so only methods in the object can manipulate them, you use
two underscores before the object name, as we have been demonstrating.
Omitting those two underscores in the attribute name, allows for the
possibility of manipulation from code outside the object.

Let\'s look at the program which uses the class we just dissected.

Notice the first line of non comment code.

``` {.python}
import oopexample
```

This line of code imports the class, which we have saved in a separate
file (module). Classes do not have to be in a separate file, but it is
almost always the case, and thus is good practice to get used to
importing the module now.

The next line:

``` {.python}
maths = oopexample.NumChange()
```

This line creates an instance of the NumChange class, stored in the
module named \"oopexample\", and stores the instance in the variable
named \"maths\". The syntax is: <i>`modulename.Classname()`</i> Next we
define the main function. Then, we get a number from the user.

The next line `added = maths.addfive(num)` sends the value of the
\"num\" variable to the method named \"addfive\", which is part of the
class we stored an instance of in the variable named \"maths\", and
stores the returned value in the variable named \"added\".

The next line `multip = maths.multiply(added)` sends the value of the
variable \"added\", to the method named \"multiply\", which is part of
the class we stored an instance of in the variable named \"maths\", and
stores the returned value in the variable named \"multip\".

The next line prints \"The manipulated value is <value of multip>\". The
last line calls the main function which executes the steps outlined
above.
