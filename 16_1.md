### Advanced use of .txt files

You might be saying to yourself, \"Well I know how to read and write to
a textfile, but what if I want to print the file without opening out
another program?\"

There are a few different ways to accomplish this. The easiest way does
open another program, but everything is taken care of in the Python
code, and doesn\'t require the user to specify a file to be printed.
This method involves invoking the subprocess of another program.

Remember the file we wrote output to in the above program? Let\'s use
that file. Keep in mind, in order to prevent some errors, this program
uses concepts from the Next chapter. Please feel free to revisit this
example after the next chapter.

``` {.Python}
import subprocess
def main():
    try:
        print("This small program invokes the print function in the Notepad application")
        #Lets print the file we created in the program above
        subprocess.call(['notepad','/p','numbers.txt'])
    except WindowsError:
        print("The called subprocess does not exist, or cannot be called.")

main()
```

The `subprocess.call` takes three arguments. The first argument in the
context of this example, should be the name of the program which you
would like to invoke the printing subprocess from. The second argument
should be the specific subprocess within that program. For simplicity,
just understand that in this program, `'/p'` is the subprocess used to
access your printer through the specified application. The last argument
should be the name of the file you want to send to the printing
subprocess. In this case, it is the same file used earlier in this
chapter.
