<p>So here we are at the end, or maybe the beginning. This tutorial is on Wikibooks, so feel free to make improvements to it. If you want to learn more about Python, <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html">The Python Tutorial</a> by <a href="http://www.python.org/~guido/">Guido van Rossum</a> has more topics that you can learn about. If you have been following this tutorial, you should be able to understand a fair amount of it. The <a href="Python_Programming" title="wikilink">Python Programming</a> wikibook can be worth looking at, too. Here are few other books which cover Python 3:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/Python">A Byte of Python by Swaroop C H</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science">DataCamp Interactive Python 3 Tutorial - Online</a></li>
<li><a href="http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/index.html">Hands-on Python Tutorial by Dr.Â Andrew N. Harrington</a></li>
<li><a href="Subject:Python_programming_language" title="wikilink">Subject:Python programming language</a> lists other Wikibooks related to Python.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully this book covers everything you have needed to get started programming. Thanks to everyone who has sent me emails about it. I enjoyed reading them, even when I have not always been the best replier.</p>
<p>Happy programming, may it change your life and the world.</p>
