<h3 id="creating-your-own-module">Creating your own module</h3>
<p>When python reads the import command, it first checks files in your directory, then site-packages or pre installed modules. To make your own module, just create a .py file in the current directory and use the command:</p>
<pre class="python3"><code>import module</code></pre>
<p>This will try to import the file module.py from your current directory and if not found, from site-packages and prepackaged modules. Changing module to the name of the .py file you created will import that file.</p>
<p>However, when it imports the module, it will basically start the file as a program, so any code on there will be run. You want to group all code into functions. ====The __name__ == __main__ trick==== In python, the variable <code>__name__</code> will give you the current name of the program. If a module you import prints the <code>__name__</code> variable, then it will print the name of the module. If the current file prints the <code>__name__</code> variable, it will print <code>__main__</code>, to show it is the main program.</p>
<p>If an if statement checks the name variable and runs code if the program is main, it can bypass the unintentional run problem created when a module is imported. Say for example you have a file, which runs some code. It also has a function you want to use in another program. However, you only want the function, not to run the code. By setting up the code below, it will only run the code if it is the file that was clicked on or started, not if it was imported.</p>
<pre class="python3"><code>if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:
    pass</code></pre>
<p>In this instance, if the file is run but not imported, it will run the pass command. You can replace the pass command with the code you want to be run when not imported. Just remember to indent the code.</p>
