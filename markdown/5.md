### If statement

As always, I believe I should start each chapter with a warm-up typing
exercise, so here is a short program to compute the absolute value of an
integer:

``` {.python}
n = int(input("Number? "))
if n < 0:
   print("The absolute value of", n, "is", -n)
else:
   print("The absolute value of", n, "is", n)
```

Here is the output from the two times that I ran this program:

`Number? `**`-34`**\
`The absolute value of -34 is 34`

`Number? `**`1`**\
`The absolute value of 1 is 1`

So what does the computer do when it sees this piece of code? First it
prompts the user for a number with the statement
\"`n = int(input("Number? "))`\". Next it reads the line
\"`if n < 0:`\". If `n` is less than zero Python runs the line
\"`print("The absolute value of", n, "is", -n)`\". Otherwise it runs the
line \"`print("The absolute value of", n, "is", n)`\".

More formally Python looks at whether the *expression* `n < 0` is true
or false. An `if` statement is followed by an indented *block* of
statements that are run when the expression is true. Optionally after
the `if` statement is an `else` statement and another indented *block*
of statements. This second block of statements is run if the expression
is false.

There are a number of different tests that an expression can have. Here
is a table of all of them:

  operator   function
  ---------- --------------------------
  `<`        less than
  `<=`       less than or equal to
  `>`        greater than
  `>=`       greater than or equal to
  `==`       equal
  `!=`       not equal

Another feature of the `if` command is the `elif` statement. It stands
for else if and means if the original `if` statement is false but the
`elif` part is true, then do the `elif` part. And if neither the `if` or
`elif` expressions are true, then do what\'s in the `else` block.
Here\'s an example:

``` {.python}
a = 0
while a < 10:
    a = a + 1
    if a > 5:
        print(a, ">", 5)
    elif a <= 3:
        print(a, "<=", 3)
    else:
        print("Neither test was true")
```

and the output:

`1 <= 3`\
`2 <= 3`\
`3 <= 3`\
`Neither test was true`\
`Neither test was true`\
`6 > 5`\
`7 > 5`\
`8 > 5`\
`9 > 5`\
`10 > 5`

Notice how the `elif a <= 3` is only tested when the `if` statement
fails to be true. There can be more than one `elif` expression, allowing
multiple tests to be done in a single `if` statement.

### Examples

``` {.python}
# This Program Demonstrates the use of the == operator
# using numbers
print(5 == 6)
# Using variables
x = 5
y = 8
print(x == y)
```

And the output

`False`\
`False`

**high\_low.py**

``` {.python}
# Plays the guessing game higher or lower 

# This should actually be something that is semi random like the
# last digits of the time or something else, but that will have to
# wait till a later chapter.  (Extra Credit, modify it to be random
# after the Modules chapter)
number = 7
guess = -1

print("Guess the number!")
while guess != number:
    guess = int(input("Is it... "))

    if guess == number:
        print("Hooray! You guessed it right!")
    elif guess < number:
        print("It's bigger...")
    elif guess > number:
        print("It's not so big.")
```

Sample run:

`Guess the number!`\
`Is it... `**`2`**\
`It's bigger...`\
`Is it... `**`5`**\
`It's bigger...`\
`Is it... `**`10`**\
`It's not so big.`\
`Is it... `**`7`**\
`Hooray! You guessed it right!`

**even.py**

``` {.python}
# Asks for a number.
# Prints if it is even or odd
 
number = float(input("Tell me a number: "))
if number % 2 == 0:
    print(int(number), "is even.")
elif number % 2 == 1:
    print(int(number), "is odd.")
else:
    print(number, "is very strange.")
```

Sample runs:

`Tell me a number: `**`3`**\
`3 is odd.`

`Tell me a number: `**`2`**\
`2 is even.`

`Tell me a number: `**`3.4895`**\
`3.4895 is very strange.`

**average1.py**

``` {.python}
# keeps asking for numbers until 0 is entered.
# Prints the average value.

count = 0
sum = 0.0
number = 1 # set to something that will not exit the while loop immediately.

print("Enter 0 to exit the loop")

while number != 0:
    number = float(input("Enter a number: "))
    if number != 0:
        count = count + 1
        sum = sum + number
    if number == 0:
        print("The average was:", sum / count)
```

**average2.py**

``` {.python}
# keeps asking for numbers until count numbers have been entered.
# Prints the average value.

#Notice that we use an integer to keep track of how many numbers, 
# but floating point numbers for the input of each number
sum = 0.0

print("This program will take several numbers then average them")
count = int(input("How many numbers would you like to average: "))
current_count = 0

while current_count < count:
    current_count = current_count + 1
    print("Number", current_count)
    number = float(input("Enter a number: "))
    sum = sum + number
    
print("The average was:", sum / count)
```

Sample runs:

`This program will take several numbers then average them`\
`How many numbers would you like to average: `**`2`**\
`Number 1`\
`Enter a number: `**`3`**\
`Number 2`\
`Enter a number: `**`5`**\
`The average was: 4.0`

`This program will take several numbers then average them`\

### Exercises

Write a program that asks the user their name, if they enter your name
say \"That is a nice name\", if they enter \"John Cleese\" or \"Michael
Palin\", tell them how you feel about them ;), otherwise tell them \"You
have a nice name.\"

Modify the higher or lower program from this section to keep track of
how many times the user has entered the wrong number. If it is more than
3 times, print \"That must have been complicated.\" at the end,
otherwise print \"Good job!\"

Write a program that asks for two numbers. If the sum of the numbers is
greater than 100, print \"That is a big number.\"
