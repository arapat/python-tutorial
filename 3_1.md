### Assignment

Okay, so we have these boxes called variables and also data that can go
into the variable. The computer will see a line like
`first_name = "Bill"` and it reads it as \"Put the string `Bill` into
the box (or variable) `first_name`\". Later on it sees the statement
`c = a + b` and it reads it as \"put the sum of `a + b` or `123.4 + 432`
which equals `555.4` into `c`\". The right hand side of the statement
(`a + b`) is *evaluated* and the result is stored in the variable on the
left hand side (`c`). This is called *assignment*, and you should not
confuse the assignment equal sign (`=`) with \"equality\" in a
mathematical sense here (that\'s what `==` will be used for later).

Here is another example of variable usage:

``` {.python}
a = 1
print(a)
a = a + 1
print(a)
a = a * 2
print(a)
```

And of course here is the output:

`1`\
`2`\
`4`

Even if the same variable appears on both sides of the equals sign
(e.g., spam = spam), the computer still reads it as, \"First find out
the data to store and then find out where the data goes.\"

One more program before I end this chapter:

``` {.python}
number = float(input("Type in a number: "))
integer = int(input("Type in an integer: "))
text = input("Type in a string: ")
print("number =", number)
print("number is a", type(number))
print("number * 2 =", number * 2)
print("integer =", integer)
print("integer is a", type(integer))
print("integer * 2 =", integer * 2)
print("text =", text)
print("text is a", type(text))
print("text * 2 =", text * 2)
```

The output I got was:

`Type in a number: `**`12.34`**\
`Type in an integer: `**`-3`**\
`Type in a string: `**`Hello`**\
`number = 12.34`\
`number is a <class 'float'>`\
`number * 2 = 24.68`\
`integer = -3`\
`integer is a <class 'int'>`\
`integer * 2 = -6`\
`text = Hello`\
`text is a <class 'str'>`\
`text * 2 = HelloHello`

Notice that `number` was created with `float(input())` ,`int(input())`
returns an integer, a number with no decimal point, while `text` created
with `input()` returns a string(can be writen as `str(input())`, too).
When you want the user to type in a decimal use `float(input())`, if you
want the user to type in an integer use `int(input())`, but if you want
the user to type in a string use `input()`.

The second half of the program uses the `type()` function which tells
what kind a variable is. Numbers are of type `int` or `float`, which are
short for *integer* and *floating point* (mostly used for decimal
numbers), respectively. Text strings are of type `str`, short for
*string*. Integers and floats can be worked on by mathematical
functions, strings cannot. Notice how when python multiplies a number by
an integer the expected thing happens. However when a string is
multiplied by an integer the result is that multiple copies of the
string are produced (i.e., `text * 2 = HelloHello`).

Operations with strings do different things than operations with
numbers. As well, some operations only work with numbers (both integers
and floating point numbers) and will give an error if a string is used.
Here are some interactive mode examples to show that some more.

    >>> print("This" + " " + "is" + " joined.")
    This is joined.
    >>> print("Ha, " * 5)
    Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, 
    >>> print("Ha, " * 5 + "ha!")
    Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, ha!
    >>> print(3 - 1)
    2
    >>> print("3" - "1")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'
    >>> 

Here is the list of some string operations:

  Operation       Symbol   Example
  --------------- -------- -------------------------------------------
  Repetition      `*`      `"i" * 5 == "iiiii"`
  Concatenation   `+`      `"Hello, " + "World!" == "Hello, World!"`
