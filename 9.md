### Variables with more than one value

You have already seen ordinary variables that store a single value.
However other variable types can hold more than one value. These are
called containers because they can contain more than one object. The
simplest type is called a list. Here is an example of a list being used:

``` {.python}
which_one = int(input("What month (1-12)? "))
months = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July',
          'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December']

if 1 <= which_one <= 12:
    print("The month is", months[which_one - 1])
```

and an output example:

`What month (1-12)? `**`3`**\
`The month is March`

In this example the `months` is a list. `months` is defined with the
lines
`months = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July',`
and `'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December']` (note
that a `\` could also be used to split a long line, but that is not
necessary in this case because Python is intelligent enough to recognize
that everything within brackets belongs together). The `[` and `]` start
and end the list with commas (`,`) separating the list items. The list
is used in `months[which_one - 1]`. A list consists of items that are
numbered starting at 0. In other words if you wanted January you would
use `months[0]`. Give a list a number and it will return the value that
is stored at that location.

The statement `if 1 <= which_one <= 12:` will only be true if
`which_one` is between one and twelve inclusive (in other words it is
what you would expect if you have seen that in algebra).

Lists can be thought of as a series of boxes. Each box has a different
value. For example, the boxes created by
`demolist = ['life', 42, 'the universe', 6, 'and', 9]` would look like
this:

  box number   0          1    2                  3   4         5
  ------------ ---------- ---- ------------------ --- --------- ---
  demolist     \"life\"   42   \"the universe\"   6   \"and\"   9

Each box is referenced by its number so the statement `demolist[0]`
would get `'life'`, `demolist[1]` would get `42` and so on up to
`demolist[5]` getting `9`.

### More features of lists

The next example is just to show a lot of other stuff lists can do (for
once I don\'t expect you to type it in, but you should probably play
around with lists in interactive mode until you are comfortable with
them.). Here goes:

``` {.python}
demolist = ["life", 42, "the universe", 6, "and", 9]
print("demolist = ",demolist)
demolist.append("everything")
print("after 'everything' was appended demolist is now:")
print(demolist)
print("len(demolist) =", len(demolist))
print("demolist.index(42) =", demolist.index(42))
print("demolist[1] =", demolist[1])

# Next we will loop through the list
for c in range(len(demolist)):
    print("demolist[", c, "] =", demolist[c])

del demolist[2]
print("After 'the universe' was removed demolist is now:")
print(demolist)
if "life" in demolist:
    print("'life' was found in demolist")
else:
    print("'life' was not found in demolist")

if "amoeba" in demolist:
    print("'amoeba' was found in demolist")

if "amoeba" not in demolist:
    print("'amoeba' was not found in demolist")

another_list = [42,7,0,123]
another_list.sort()
print("The sorted another_list is", another_list)
```

The output is:

`demolist =  ['life', 42, 'the universe', 6, 'and', 9]`\
`after 'everything' was appended demolist is now:`\
`['life', 42, 'the universe', 6, 'and', 9, 'everything']`\
`len(demolist) = 7`\
`demolist.index(42) = 1`\
`demolist[1] = 42`\
`demolist[ 0 ] = life`\
`demolist[ 1 ] = 42`\
`demolist[ 2 ] = the universe`\
`demolist[ 3 ] = 6`\
`demolist[ 4 ] = and`\
`demolist[ 5 ] = 9`\
`demolist[ 6 ] = everything`\
`After 'the universe' was removed demolist is now:`\
`['life', 42, 6, 'and', 9, 'everything']`\
`'life' was found in demolist`\
`'amoeba' was not found in demolist`\
`The sorted another_list is [0, 7, 42, 123]`

This example uses a whole bunch of new functions. Notice that you can
just `print` a whole list. Next the `append` function is used to add a
new item to the end of the list. `len` returns how many items are in a
list. The valid indexes (as in numbers that can be used inside of the
`[]`) of a list range from 0 to `len - 1`. The `index` function tells
where the first location of an item is located in a list. Notice how
`demolist.index(42)` returns 1, and when `demolist[1]` is run it returns
42. To get help on all the functions a list provides for you, type
`help(list)` in the interactive Python interpreter.

The line `# Next we will loop through the list` is a just a reminder to
the programmer (also called a *comment*). Python ignores everything that
is written after a `#` on the current line. Next the lines:

``` {.python}
for c in range(len(demolist)):
    print('demolist[', c, '] =', demolist[c])
```

create a variable `c`, which starts at 0 and is incremented until it
reaches the last index of the list. Meanwhile the `print` statement
prints out each element of the list.

A much better way to do the above is:

``` {.python}
for c, x in enumerate(demolist):
    print("demolist[", c, "] =", x)
```

The `del` command can be used to remove a given element in a list. The
next few lines use the `in` operator to test if an element is in or is
not in a list. The `sort` function sorts the list. This is useful if you
need a list in order from smallest number to largest or alphabetical.
Note that this rearranges the list. In summary, for a list, the
following operations occur:

  example                      explanation
  ---------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  `demolist[2]`                accesses the element at index 2
  `demolist[2] = 3`            sets the element at index 2 to be 3
  `del demolist[2]`            removes the element at index 2
  `len(demolist)`              returns the length of `demolist`
  `"value" in demolist`        is *True* if `"value"` is an element in `demolist`
  `"value" not in demolist`    is *True* if `"value"` is not an element in `demolist`
  `another_list.sort()`        sorts `another_list`. Note that the list must be all numbers or all strings to be sorted.
  `demolist.index("value")`    returns the index of the first place that `"value"` occurs
  `demolist.append("value")`   adds an element `"value"` at the end of the list
  `demolist.remove("value")`   removes the first occurrence of value from `demolist` (same as `del demolist[demolist.index("value")]`)

This next example uses these features in a more useful way:

``` {.python}
menu_item = 0
namelist = []
while menu_item != 9:
    print("--------------------")
    print("1. Print the list")
    print("2. Add a name to the list")
    print("3. Remove a name from the list")
    print("4. Change an item in the list")
    print("9. Quit")
    menu_item = int(input("Pick an item from the menu: "))
    if menu_item == 1:
        current = 0
        if len(namelist) > 0:
            while current < len(namelist):
                print(current, ".", namelist[current])
                current = current + 1
        else:
            print("List is empty")
    elif menu_item == 2:
        name = input("Type in a name to add: ")
        namelist.append(name)
    elif menu_item == 3:
        del_name = input("What name would you like to remove: ")
        if del_name in namelist:
            # namelist.remove(del_name) would work just as fine
            item_number = namelist.index(del_name)
            del namelist[item_number]
            # The code above only removes the first occurrence of
            # the name.  The code below from Gerald removes all.
            # while del_name in namelist:
            #       item_number = namelist.index(del_name)
            #       del namelist[item_number]
        else:
            print(del_name, "was not found")
    elif menu_item == 4:
        old_name = input("What name would you like to change: ")
        if old_name in namelist:
            item_number = namelist.index(old_name)
            new_name = input("What is the new name: ")
            namelist[item_number] = new_name
        else:
            print(old_name, "was not found")

print("Goodbye")
```

And here is part of the output:

`--------------------`\
`1. Print the list`\
`2. Add a name to the list`\
`3. Remove a name from the list`\
`4. Change an item in the list`\
`9. Quit`\
\
`Pick an item from the menu: `**`2`**\
`Type in a name to add: `**`Jack`**\
\
`Pick an item from the menu: `**`2`**\
`Type in a name to add: `**`Jill`**\
\
`Pick an item from the menu: `**`1`**\
`0 . Jack`\
`1 . Jill`\
\
`Pick an item from the menu: `**`3`**\
`What name would you like to remove: `**`Jack`**\
\
`Pick an item from the menu: `**`4`**\
`What name would you like to change: `**`Jill`**\
`What is the new name: `**`Jill`` ``Peters`**\
\
`Pick an item from the menu: `**`1`**\
`0 . Jill Peters`\
\
`Pick an item from the menu: `**`9`**\
`Goodbye`

That was a long program. Let\'s take a look at the source code. The line
`namelist = []` makes the variable `namelist` a list with no items (or
elements). The next important line is `while menu_item != 9:`. This line
starts a loop that allows the menu system for this program. The next few
lines display a menu and decide which part of the program to run.

The section

``` {.python}
current = 0
if len(namelist) > 0:
    while current < len(namelist):
        print(current, ".", namelist[current])
        current = current + 1
else:
    print("List is empty")
```

goes through the list and prints each name. `len(namelist)` tells how
many items are in the list. If `len` returns `0`, then the list is
empty.

Then, a few lines later, the statement `namelist.append(name)` appears.
It uses the `append` function to add an item to the end of the list.
Jump down another two lines, and notice this section of code:

``` {.python}
item_number = namelist.index(del_name)
del namelist[item_number]
```

Here the `index` function is used to find the index value that will be
used later to remove the item. `del namelist[item_number]` is used to
remove an element of the list.

The next section

``` {.python}
old_name = input("What name would you like to change: ")
if old_name in namelist:
    item_number = namelist.index(old_name)
    new_name = input("What is the new name: ")
    namelist[item_number] = new_name
else:
   print(old_name, "was not found")
```

uses `index` to find the `item_number` and then puts `new_name` where
the `old_name` was.

Congratulations, with lists under your belt, you now know enough of the
language that you could do any computations that a computer can do (this
is technically known as
[Turing-Completeness](Wikipedia:Turing_completeness "wikilink")). Of
course, there are still many features that are used to make your life
easier.

### Examples

**test.py**

``` {.python}
## This program runs a test of knowledge

# First get the test questions
# Later this will be modified to use file io.
def get_questions():
    # notice how the data is stored as a list of lists
    return [["What color is the daytime sky on a clear day? ", "blue"],
            ["What is the answer to life, the universe and everything? ", "42"],
            ["What is a three letter word for mouse trap? ", "cat"]]

# This will test a single question
# it takes a single question in
# it returns True if the user typed the correct answer, otherwise False

def check_question(question_and_answer):
    # extract the question and the answer from the list
    # This function takes a list with two elements, a question and an answer.  
    question = question_and_answer[0]   
    answer = question_and_answer[1]
    # give the question to the user
    given_answer = input(question)
    # compare the user's answer to the tester's answer
    if answer == given_answer:
        print("Correct")
        return True
    else:
        print("Incorrect, correct was:", answer)
        return False

# This will run through all the questions
def run_test(questions):
    if len(questions) == 0:
        print("No questions were given.")
        # the return exits the function
        return
    index = 0
    right = 0
    while index < len(questions):
        # Check the question
        #Note that this is extracting a question and answer list from the list of lists.
        if check_question(questions[index]): 
            right = right + 1
        # go to the next question
        index = index + 1
    # notice the order of the computation, first multiply, then divide
    print("You got", right * 100 / len(questions),\
           "% right out of", len(questions))

# now let's get the questions from the get_questions function, and
# send the returned list of lists as an argument to the run_test function.

run_test(get_questions())
```

The values `True` and `False` point to 1 and 0, respectively. They are
often used in sanity checks, loop conditions etc. You will learn more
about this a little bit later (chapter [Boolean
Expressions](../Boolean_Expressions "wikilink")). Please note that
get\_questions() is essentially a list because even though it\'s
technically a function, returning a list of lists is the only thing it
does.

Sample Output:

`What color is the daytime sky on a clear day? `**`green`**\
`Incorrect, correct was: blue`\
`What is the answer to life, the universe and everything? `**`42`**\
`Correct`\
`What is a three letter word for mouse trap? `**`cat`**\
`Correct`\
`You got 66 % right out of 3`

### Exercises

Expand the test.py program so it has a menu giving the option of taking
the test, viewing the list of questions and answers, and an option to
quit. Also, add a new question to ask, \"What noise does a truly
advanced machine make?\" with the answer of \"ping\".
